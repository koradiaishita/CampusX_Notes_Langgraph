# 🤖 Agentic AI - Complete Study Notes

## 📋 Overview
This is the second video in the Agentic AI using LangGraph playlist, focusing on the formal definition and study of Agentic AI.

## 🎯 What is Agentic AI?

> **Definition**: Agentic AI is a type of AI that can take up a task and goal from a user and then work towards completing it on its own with minimal human guidance. It plans, takes action, adapts to changes, and seeks help only when necessary.

### 🔄 Key Difference from Generative AI

| **Generative AI** 💬 | **Agentic AI** 🤖 |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Reactive** - Responds to specific questions | **Proactive** - Takes initiative |
| Requires step-by-step guidance | Works autonomously |
| Example: ChatGPT answering queries | Example: AI agent completing complex tasks |

**Travel Example** ✈️:
- **Generative AI**: You ask "What's the best way to reach Goa on the 15th?" → It answers only that question
- **Agentic AI**: You say "I want to go to Goa from X date to Y date" → It plans flights, hotels, itinerary automatically

1. **📝 Goal Setting**
   - User: "I want to hire a Backend Engineer (Remote, 2-4 years experience)"

2. **🧠 Planning Phase**
   - Draft Job Description (JD)
   - Post on best job platforms (LinkedIn, Naukri)
   - Monitor applications constantly
   - Screen candidates
   - Schedule interviews
   - Send offer letters
   - Start onboarding process

3. **⚙️ Execution Phase**

   - Suggests changes: Change to "Full Stack Engineer", Run LinkedIn ads
   - Waits for approval and implements
   
   **Step 4**: Candidate Screening 👥
   - Uses resume parser tool
   - Analyzes all applicants
   - Categorizes: 2 strong, 3 partial, 3 weak matches
   
   **Step 5**: Interview Scheduling 📅

## ⭐ Six Key Characteristics of Agentic AI

### 1. 🔓 Autonomy

**Definition**: The ability to make decisions and take actions independently without step-by-step human instructions.

**How it's Implemented**:
- **Execution Autonomy**: Automatically executes plan steps
- **Decision Making**: Decides which candidates to shortlist
- **Tool Usage**: Selects appropriate tools for each task

**Controlling Autonomy** 🎛️:
- **Scope Definition**: Limit which tools/actions agent can perform independently
- **Human-in-the-Loop** 👤: Insert checkpoints requiring human approval
- **Override Controls** ⏸️: Allow users to stop, pause, or change behavior
- **Guard Rails & Policies** 🚧: Define hard rules and ethical boundaries

<img width="1034" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c6e44de-fba8-45c5-919e-35a2de7b5632" />


**⚠️ Risks of Uncontrolled Autonomy**:
- Rolling out job offers with incorrect salary/terms
- Biased hiring based on nationality or age
- Overspending on ads without permission

---

### 2. 🎯 Goal-Oriented

**Definition**: Operates with a persistent objective in mind and continuously directs actions to achieve that objective.

**Goal serves as a compass** 🧭 for the system's autonomy.

**Types of Goals**:
- **Independent Goals**: "Hire a Backend Engineer"
- **Goals with Constraints**: "Hire a Backend Engineer from India, Remote, under $X budget"

**Goal Storage** (JSON format):
```json
{
  "main_goal": "Hire a Backend Engineer",
  "constraints": {
    "experience": "2-4 years",
    "remote": true,
    "tech_stack": ["Python", "Django", "AWS"]
  },
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15",
  "progress": {
    "jd_created": true,
    "posted_on": ["LinkedIn", "Naukri"],
    "applications": 8,
    "interviews_scheduled": 2
  }
}
```

**🔄 Goals Can Be Altered Mid-Way**:
Example: Change from "Hire Backend Engineer" → "Find a Freelancer for project"

---

### 3. 📋 Planning

**Definition**: The ability to break down a high-level goal into a structured sequence of actions and sub-goals.

> **Most Important Concept**: Agentic AI operates in 2 steps:
> 1. **Planning** - Break down goal and create plan
> 2. **Execution** - Execute the plan step-by-step
> 
> This is an **iterative loop** 🔄

**Three-Step Planning Process**:

#### Step 1: Generate Multiple Candidate Plans 🗺️
- Planning is a **search problem**
- Initial State → Final State (multiple paths exist)
- System generates multiple approaches

**Example Plans**:
- **Plan A**: Post on job portals (LinkedIn, Naukri, AngelList) + Promote
- **Plan B**: Internal referrals + Hiring agency

#### Step 2: Evaluate Plans ⚖️
Evaluation criteria:
- **Efficiency** ⚡: Which is fastest?
- **Tool Availability** 🔧: Do we have required tools?
- **Cost** 💰: Budget constraints
- **Risk** ⚠️: Failure probability
- **Alignment with Constraints** ✅: Matches requirements?

#### Step 3: Select Best Plan ✨
Selection methods:
- **Human-in-the-Loop Input** 👤: Ask human supervisor
- **Pre-programmed Policy** 📜: Automated decision based on rules

---

### 4. 🧠 Reasoning

**Definition**: The cognitive process through which an AI system interprets information, draws conclusions, and makes decisions (both while planning and executing).

**Why Important?**: Reasoning is needed in BOTH planning and execution stages.

**Example**: Phone Theft Scenario 📱
1. **Interpret Information**: Phone is stolen
2. **Draw Conclusions**: Thief might misuse my number
3. **Make Decisions**: Block number with Airtel

**Reasoning in Planning Stage** 📝:
- **Goal Decomposition**: Break "Hire Backend Engineer" into steps
- **Tool Selection**: Determine which tool for each step (e.g., Google search for salary info)
- **Resource Estimation**: Time, dependencies, risks

**Reasoning in Execution Stage** ⚙️:
- **Decision Making**: Interview 2 or 3 candidates?
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: When to ask human vs. decide independently
- **Error Handling**: LinkedIn server down → Wait? Notify human? Use alternative platform?

---

### 5. 🔄 Adaptability

**Definition**: The ability to modify plans, strategies, and actions in response to unexpected conditions while staying aligned with the goal.

**Example from AI Recruiter**:
- Low applications after 3 days
- Adapts by: Running LinkedIn ads + Modifying JD to "Full Stack Engineer"

**Reasons for Adaptation**:

1. **Failures** ❌
   - Tool/API fails (e.g., Calendar API down)
   - Solution: Ask human directly for availability

2. **External Feedback** 📊
   - Environment provides unexpected data
   - Example: Low application numbers from LinkedIn

3. **Goal Changes** 🎯
   - Mid-way goal modification
   - Example: "Hire Backend Engineer" → "Find Freelancer"

---

### 6. 🧩 Context Awareness

**Definition**: The ability to understand, retain, and utilize relevant information from ongoing tasks, past interactions, user preferences, and environmental cues to make better decisions throughout a multi-step process.

**Types of Context Stored**:

1. **Original Goal** 🎯
   - Core objective: "Hire Backend Engineer"

2. **Progress & Conversation History** 📈
   - JD finalized and posted on LinkedIn
   - All chat history with human supervisor

3. **Environment State** 🌍
   - Job posted on LinkedIn
   - 8 applications received
   - Ad budget: $X remaining for 2 days

4. **Tool Responses** 🔧
   - Resume parser: "Candidate B has 3 years Django + AWS experience"
   - Calendar API: "Human is free at 2:00 PM"

5. **User Preferences** 👤
   - Company prefers remote candidates
   - Human likes interview questions in Google Docs

6. **Policies & Guard Rails** 🚧
   - "Don't send offer letter without approval"
   - "Never use paid ad platforms without permission"

**💾 Memory Types**:
- **Short-term Memory**: Current session info (tool responses, immediate decisions)
- **Long-term Memory**: Goals, past interactions, user preferences, cross-session decisions
